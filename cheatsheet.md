This file will contain documentation for all commands available in your game.
1. Select/Unselect: Users can directly select lights to turn on by clicking the green rectangle. When selected, the rectangle will turn orange. Clicking it again will turn the rectangle back to green. Make sure to finalize your selected lights before hitting the Confirm button.

2. Confirm: Clicking the Confirm button in the control panel signifies that you have completed your move for this turn. The selected lights will turn yellow, indicating that they are officially turned on.

3. Start Over: Users can click the Start Over button at any time, whether in the middle of the game or at the end. The game will restart with all the lights turned off, and the current player will reset to Player 1.

4. Rule: Clicking the Rule button will display a message introducing the game rules. This feature is designed for users who are unfamiliar with how the game is played.

Note:  It's a good idea to also make this list available inside the game, in response to a `HELP` command.
